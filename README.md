## Description
- Motivation: My motivation for making this was to really solidify my understanding of Model and Route creation.
- Why: I built this application to support the front end of an e-commerce site with a working backend.
- What problem does this solve: This solves the problem of being able to store data in a database for an online website
- What I learned: I learned how to use Sequelize.js in order to manipulate SQL tables from JavaScript
- Challanges: My biggest challenge was in connecting all of the separate SQL tables together by going through a common table that had multiple foreign keys.
